## Reflections
This ePortfolio connects classroom learning to professional practice. Enhancing artifacts taught me:

- Defensive programming and clean code principles  
- Efficient algorithms and data structure selection  
- Database persistence and unit testing  

Integration of journals and milestones provides evidence of skills, growth, and readiness for backend development and professional software engineering roles.
